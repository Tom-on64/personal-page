    So, this is the first web devlog i'm writing, so it might not be very good, but i'll try.
    I'm writing this in my very experimental Markdown-like format.

    [Here's it's code so far!](https://github.com/Tom-on64/personal-page/blob/main/public/logs/log.js) 
    
    I really don't know what to write here so yeah.

    Today i finished working on the [Project](../project/) tab, where i added the MyUtils, Infinity Clicker, JSONStore and kern.
    I also made this page and changed some global styling.

    If you want to see it, here's the [source code](https://github.com/Tom-on64/personal-page)
    I want to add categories to these logs, but that's not for today. So that's it!

    Bye!
